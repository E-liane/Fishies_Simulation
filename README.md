# 🐟 Fish School Simulation - Godot Engine

This project is a real-time fish school (shoal) simulation built using the **Godot Engine**.  
It mimics the natural flocking behavior of fish with lifelike group movement based on simple rules.

---

## 🎮 Demo

Each fish is an autonomous agent that follows three core behaviors:

- **Separation**: Avoid crowding close neighbors  
- **Alignment**: Match the direction of nearby fish  
- **Cohesion**: Move toward the center of the group  

The combination of these rules produces natural, emergent movement patterns.
